"""
561. Array Partition I
Given an array of 2n integers,
your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer,
say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn)
which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

Input: [1,4,3,2]
Å
Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
