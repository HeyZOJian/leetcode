476. Number Complement
Description:
    Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
    The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
    1.The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    2.You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

Input:
    5
Output:
    2
Explanation:
    The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
    and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
